# Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows FIFO (first in ,first out). The data structure uses a linked list and call its append to add to the queue, and delete function to remove from the back of the queue. The difference between a queue and a stack is the order in which items are removed.

An example of a queue is a super market line where the first one in the line is also the first out of the line.
